This repository aims to serve as the guide for a 3 hours workshop on
C++ aimed at CS/Informatics Engineering students and Computer
Engineering students that are already familiar with programming in C.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository also contains several code examples and a programming
exercise. To build and run it, follow the following steps:

 1. use the provided Makefile to build the example exercises
        you can build them all by simply running `make`
 2. run the program by running `build/${program-id}`, e.g.
        `build/vector-c`

To build a specific example or exercise, run `make build/${program-id}`
and to clean up, run `make clean` or delete the _build_ directory.
